# LogWatch

## About ##

When finished it should tail a log file, and push notifications to slack Incoming WebHook.

## How to use ##

1. Create Slack account https://slack.com/
2. Go to "Configure Integrations" and at the bottom of the page under "DIY Integrations & Customizations" choose "Incoming WebHooks". Chose a channel or create a new one and copy/paste the Webhook URL into the code (I know, magic numbers... hardcoded stuff; In the future there will be some kind of config JSON).
